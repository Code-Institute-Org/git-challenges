# Local Repository

- Create a new folder called `my-first-git-project`
- Initialize it as a git project
- Open the folder in Sublime Text
- Create a basic `README.md` with the explanation of some project you'd like to do (use headers, lists... )
- Commit the changes using the message “Added README file”
- Do a `git log` when done.
